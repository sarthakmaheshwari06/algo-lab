        "Counting sort, like radix sort and bucket sort, is an integer based algorithm (i.e. the values of the input array are assumed to be integers). Hence counting sort is among the fastest sorting algorithms around, in theory. The  particular distinction for counting sort is that it creates a bucket for each value and keep a counter in each bucket. Then each time a value is encountered in the input collection, the appropriate counter is incremented. Because counting sort creates a bucket for each value, an imposing restriction is that the maximum value in the input array be known beforehand. Bucket sort uses a hash function to distribute values; counting sort, on the other hand, creates a counter for each value -- hence the name.\n",
